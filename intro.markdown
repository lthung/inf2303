# Course Objectives

The course will explore the production of free / open source software
  (“F/OSS”) — that is, software that users are allowed to modify and
  redistribute without paying royalties.
In the recent years such software has grown in prominence.
Today it includes both popular end-user software such as Mozilla
  Firefox and Google Chrome, as well as back-end software that today
  dominate in many domains of IT infrastructure (e.g. the Apache
  web-server and the GNU/Linux operating system).
Availability of such software presents both opportunities and
  challenges to today’s IT professionals.
Is F/OSS really a “free lunch” or does it present hidden costs? Why do
  many practitioners insist that choosing royalty-free F/OSS products
  should not be about saving money on royalties?
When does it make sense for an organization to adopt a F/OSS solution
  over a proprietary one?
When would it make sense to develop a software solution in house and
  offer it to the world with a F/OSS license?
To answer such questions it becomes important to understand what F/OSS
  is (and what is the difference between “free” and “open source”),
  and where it comes from.
We would also need to understand who makes such software and why they
  do so.
We will ask why individuals and organizations contribute time and
  money to F/OSS and how they coordinate their activities.
We will also ask whether the open source software model can be applied
  to other goods, e.g., “open source textbooks” or “open source
  pharmaceuticals”?
In addressing those questions we will draw on a range of social
  science theories, looking at F/OSS from economic, political and
  cultural sides.
We will also ask questions about the technical infrastructure used by
  F/OSS projects.

# Student Learning Objectives

Students will develop an understanding of free / open source
  software ecosystem, including its history and current practices.
They will also learn to draw on their understanding of F/OSS to
  analyze the opportunities and challenges that such software presents
  in specific contexts faced by information professionals.
Finally, they will learn how to extend their observations about free /
  open source software to other information products.

# Relationship to Program-Level Master of Information Student Learning Outcomes

The course will help students understand and become conversant with an
  important set of information practices: production of free / open
  source software.
It will also provide them with a foundation for analyzing peer
  production of other information products. (Outcome 1.)

Students will develop knowledge and values that will help them
  exercise leadership when it comes to making software choices that
  broader access to information services for all. (Outcome 2.)

Students’ work on the term paper will help them develop their
  research abilities and to apply course material to a specific domain
  of information studies. (Outcome 3.)

Students will gain knowledge of a range of social science theories
  relevant to understanding production of information goods. (Outcome
  4.)

Student learning outcomes for the MI program:

In addition to the above learning outcomes, students will develop and refine their presentation skills (i.e. differentiation between “good” and “great” presentations) and conflict resolution skills (i.e. ability to resolve conflicts in a group setting).  These skills will make MI students more marketable in the workplace.
